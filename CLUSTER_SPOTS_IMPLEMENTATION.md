# SKCC Logger - Cluster Spots Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated SKCC-filtered cluster spots using Fabian DJ5CW's CW-Club RBN gateway. The logger now displays real-time SKCC member activity from the Reverse Beacon Network.

## Quick Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Internet Connection**: Required for cluster spot reception
- **Python Dependencies**: Included in standard library (socket, threading, tkinter)
- **SKCC Membership**: Must be a registered SKCC member for club filtering

### Setup Steps
1. **Download/Clone Repository**: Get the latest version from GitHub
2. **Launch Logger**: Run `python w4gns_skcc_logger.py` or `python gui/tk_qso_form_clean.py`
3. **Connect to Cluster**: Click "Connect to Cluster" button in the Cluster Spots section
4. **Enter Callsign**: When prompted, enter your callsign (e.g., "W4GNS-SKCC")
5. **Start Spotting**: SKCC member spots will appear in real-time

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Cluster Spots Features
✅ **SKCC-Only Filtering**: Pre-filtered feed shows only SKCC member activity
✅ **Real-Time Display**: Live spots shown in dedicated treeview
✅ **Auto-Fill Integration**: Double-click spots to auto-fill QSO form
✅ **Connection Management**: Easy connect/disconnect with status display
✅ **Thread-Safe Updates**: Background spot reception with GUI updates

### 2. Technical Implementation

#### SKCC Cluster Client (`utils/cluster_client.py`)
```python
class SKCCClusterClient:
    """Connects to rbn.telegraphy.de for SKCC-filtered spots"""
    - Telnet connection to CW-Club RBN gateway
    - Automatic SKCC club filtering (set/clubs)
    - Duplicate reduction (set/nodupes)
    - Thread-safe spot parsing and callbacks
    - Graceful connection handling
```

#### Cluster Spot Data Structure
```python
@dataclass
class ClusterSpot:
    callsign: str           # SKCC member callsign
    frequency: float        # Frequency in MHz
    spotter: str           # RBN spotter callsign
    time_utc: datetime     # Spot time in UTC
    snr: Optional[int]     # Signal strength if available
    speed: Optional[int]   # CW speed (WPM) if available
    
    @property
    def band(self) -> str  # Auto-calculated band
```

#### GUI Integration
- **Connection Control**: Connect/Disconnect button with status indicator
- **Spots Display**: Treeview showing Time, Call, Freq, Band, Spotter, SNR
- **Auto-Fill**: Double-click any spot to populate QSO form
- **Real-Time Updates**: New spots appear at top, limited to 50 most recent

### 3. Connection Details

#### RBN Gateway: rbn.telegraphy.de
- **Host**: rbn.telegraphy.de
- **Port**: 7000 (Telnet)
- **Protocol**: Standard telnet (no encryption required)
- **Login**: Uses callsign (W4GNS-SKCC format)
- **Filtering**: Automatic SKCC club filtering via web interface settings
- **Gateway Operator**: Fabian DJ5CW
- **Status Page**: [rbn.telegraphy.de/status](http://rbn.telegraogy.de/status)

#### Network Requirements:
- **Outbound TCP**: Port 7000 must be accessible
- **Firewall**: Allow connections to rbn.telegraphy.de
- **Internet**: Stable connection recommended for continuous spotting

#### Commands Used:
- `set/clubs` - Enable club-filtered spots only
- `set/nodupes` - Reduce duplicate spots
- `set/raw` - Switch to unfiltered (not used)

#### Filter Configuration:
The gateway uses web-based filter configuration at [rbn.telegraphy.de/web](http://rbn.telegraphy.de/web):
1. Enter your callsign
2. Select "Club members" filter
3. Choose "SKCC" from the club dropdown
4. Save settings - they persist for future connections

### 4. Troubleshooting

#### Connection Issues:
- **Cannot Connect**: Check internet connection and firewall settings
- **No Spots Appearing**: Verify SKCC filter is enabled at rbn.telegraphy.de/web
- **Connection Drops**: Normal - client automatically attempts reconnection
- **Wrong Spots**: Ensure SKCC club filter is properly set on web interface

#### Common Solutions:
- **Port Blocked**: Try connecting from different network location
- **Filter Not Working**: Re-configure filters at rbn.telegraphy.de/web
- **Callsign Format**: Use format "YOURCALL-SKCC" for best identification
- **Heavy Activity**: Spots may be delayed during contests or high activity periods

### 5. User Interface

#### Cluster Control Section:
```
SKCC Cluster Spots:
[Connect to Cluster] Connected as W4GNS-SKCC
```

#### Spots Display:
```
Time  Call      Freq (MHz)  Band  Spotter     SNR
09:30 DK4AN     7.026       40M   DF2CK-#     25dB
09:30 G4FOC     21.025      15M   DD5XX-#     18dB
09:30 DL6LV     14.052      20M   LA6TPA-#    32dB
```

#### Auto-Fill Workflow:
1. **Spot Appears**: SKCC member spotted by RBN
2. **Double-Click**: User double-clicks interesting spot
3. **Auto-Fill**: Callsign, frequency, and band populate in QSO form
4. **Ready to Log**: User can immediately start QSO timing

#### Pro Tips:
- **Fresh Spots**: Most recent spots appear at top of list
- **Band Monitoring**: Watch for activity on your preferred bands
- **State Info**: Combined with roster data for complete station information
- **Timing Integration**: Start time begins automatically when callsign is filled
