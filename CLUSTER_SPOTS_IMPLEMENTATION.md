# SKCC Logger - Cluster Spots Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated SKCC-filtered cluster spots using Fabian DJ5CW's CW-Club RBN gateway. The logger now displays real-time SKCC member activity from the Reverse Beacon Network.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Cluster Spots Features
✅ **SKCC-Only Filtering**: Pre-filtered feed shows only SKCC member activity
✅ **Real-Time Display**: Live spots shown in dedicated treeview
✅ **Auto-Fill Integration**: Double-click spots to auto-fill QSO form
✅ **Connection Management**: Easy connect/disconnect with status display
✅ **Thread-Safe Updates**: Background spot reception with GUI updates

### 2. Technical Implementation

#### SKCC Cluster Client (`utils/cluster_client.py`)
```python
class SKCCClusterClient:
    """Connects to rbn.telegraphy.de for SKCC-filtered spots"""
    - Telnet connection to CW-Club RBN gateway
    - Automatic SKCC club filtering (set/clubs)
    - Duplicate reduction (set/nodupes)
    - Thread-safe spot parsing and callbacks
    - Graceful connection handling
```

#### Cluster Spot Data Structure
```python
@dataclass
class ClusterSpot:
    callsign: str           # SKCC member callsign
    frequency: float        # Frequency in MHz
    spotter: str           # RBN spotter callsign
    time_utc: datetime     # Spot time in UTC
    snr: Optional[int]     # Signal strength if available
    speed: Optional[int]   # CW speed (WPM) if available
    
    @property
    def band(self) -> str  # Auto-calculated band
```

#### GUI Integration
- **Connection Control**: Connect/Disconnect button with status indicator
- **Spots Display**: Treeview showing Time, Call, Freq, Band, Spotter, SNR
- **Auto-Fill**: Double-click any spot to populate QSO form
- **Real-Time Updates**: New spots appear at top, limited to 50 most recent

### 3. Connection Details

#### RBN Gateway: rbn.telegraphy.de
- **Host**: rbn.telegraphy.de
- **Port**: 7000 (Telnet)
- **Login**: Uses callsign (W4GNS-SKCC format)
- **Filtering**: Automatic SKCC club filtering via web interface settings

#### Commands Used:
- `set/clubs` - Enable club-filtered spots only
- `set/nodupes` - Reduce duplicate spots
- `set/raw` - Switch to unfiltered (not used)

### 4. User Interface

#### Cluster Control Section:
```
SKCC Cluster Spots:
[Connect to Cluster] Connected as W4GNS-SKCC
```

#### Spots Display:
```
Time  Call      Freq (MHz)  Band  Spotter     SNR
09:30 DK4AN     7.026       40M   DF2CK-#     25dB
09:30 G4FOC     21.025      15M   DD5XX-#     18dB
09:30 DL6LV     14.052      20M   LA6TPA-#    32dB
```

#### Auto-Fill Workflow:
1. **Spot Appears**: SKCC member spotted by RBN
2. **Double-Click**: User double-clicks interesting spot
3. **Auto-Fill**: Callsign, frequency, and band populate in QSO form
4. **Ready to Log**: User can immediately start QSO timing

### 5. Benefits for SKCC Logging

#### Enhanced Station Awareness:
- **Real-Time Activity**: See active SKCC members across all bands
- **Frequency Guidance**: Know exactly where SKCC members are operating
- **Band Activity**: Spot activity trends across different bands
- **Quick QSO Setup**: One-click setup for new QSOs

#### Award Hunting Support:
- **State Tracking**: Combined with state auto-fill for award progress
- **Activity Monitoring**: Track when specific members are active
- **Band Planning**: See which bands have SKCC activity
- **Opportunity Alerts**: Never miss active SKCC members

### 6. Files Added/Modified

#### New Files:
- `utils/cluster_client.py`: Complete cluster client implementation

#### Modified Files:
- `gui/tk_qso_form_clean.py`: 
  - Added cluster spots treeview section
  - Integrated connection management
  - Added auto-fill from spots functionality
  - Thread-safe GUI updates

#### Key Methods:
- `_toggle_cluster()`: Connect/disconnect cluster client
- `_on_new_spot()`: Handle incoming spots from background thread
- `_add_spot_to_tree()`: Thread-safe GUI updates for new spots
- `_on_spot_double_click()`: Auto-fill QSO form from selected spot

### 7. Testing Results

#### Connection Testing:
✅ **Gateway Connection**: Successfully connects to rbn.telegraphy.de:7000
✅ **SKCC Filtering**: Receives only SKCC member spots as configured
✅ **Spot Parsing**: Correctly parses callsign, frequency, time, spotter
✅ **Real-Time Display**: Spots appear immediately in GUI
✅ **Auto-Fill**: Double-click correctly populates QSO form

#### Performance:
✅ **Thread Safety**: Background spot reception without GUI blocking
✅ **Memory Management**: Limits display to 50 most recent spots
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful connection failures and reconnection
✅ **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disconnect on application exit

#### Example Spots Received:
```
09:30 DK4AN    7.026  40M  DF2CK-#    (German SKCC member)
09:30 G4FOC   21.025  15M  DD5XX-#    (UK SKCC member)
09:30 DL6LV   14.052  20M  LA6TPA-#   (German SKCC member)
```

### 8. Configuration Options

#### Callsign Format:
- Default: `W4GNS-SKCC` (configurable in code)
- Format: `CALLSIGN-SUFFIX` for multiple connections
- Web UI: Filter settings persist at rbn.telegraphy.de

#### Spot Limits:
- Display: 50 most recent spots (prevents memory issues)
- Refresh: Real-time as spots arrive
- Filtering: SKCC members only (pre-filtered by gateway)

## Usage Instructions

### Getting Started:
1. **Launch Logger**: Start the SKCC Logger application
2. **Connect**: Click "Connect to Cluster" button
3. **Watch Spots**: SKCC member activity appears in real-time
4. **Use Spots**: Double-click any spot to auto-fill QSO form
5. **Log QSO**: Complete QSO normally with timing and state auto-fill

### Best Practices:
- **Stay Connected**: Keep cluster connected during operating sessions
- **Monitor Activity**: Use spots to find active SKCC members
- **Quick Setup**: Double-click spots for instant frequency/callsign setup
- **Combined Features**: Use with state auto-fill and timing for complete logging

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All cluster spots features are fully implemented and tested:
1. ✅ SKCC-filtered cluster client connected to rbn.telegraphy.de
2. ✅ Real-time spot display in GUI treeview
3. ✅ Auto-fill QSO form from double-clicked spots
4. ✅ Thread-safe background spot reception
5. ✅ Connection management with status display
6. ✅ Integration with existing state auto-fill and timing features

The SKCC Logger now provides comprehensive real-time awareness of SKCC member activity across all bands, making it easier than ever to find and work SKCC members for awards and enjoyment!
