# SKCC Logger - QSO Timing Enhancement for Ragchew Award

## Overview
Successfully implemented QSO start and end time tracking to support ragchew award requirements. The logger now captures precise timing information for each QSO.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. QSO Timing Features
✅ **Start Time Capture**: QSO start time is automatically recorded when callsign is entered
✅ **End Time Capture**: QSO end time is recorded when "Save QSO" button is pressed  
✅ **Duration Display**: Real-time QSO duration shown in the interface
✅ **ADIF Export**: Both TIME_ON and TIME_OFF fields included in ADIF output
✅ **Ragchew Support**: Proper timing data for ragchew award validation

### 2. User Experience Enhancements

#### Timing Display:
- **Normal State**: Shows current local and UTC time
- **QSO in Progress**: Shows duration and start time
  ```
  QSO in progress: 15:23 (Started: 09:14:00 UTC)
  ```

#### Save Confirmation:
Enhanced save dialog now shows:
```
QSO with W4GNS saved to ADIF file.
Duration: 15:23
Country: United States
State: VA
Start: 09:14:00 UTC
End: 09:29:23 UTC
```

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### QSO Model Updates:
```python
@dataclass
class QSO:
    call: str
    when: datetime               # Start time
    time_off: Optional[datetime] # End time for ragchew tracking
    # ... other fields
```

#### ADIF Output Enhancement:
- **TIME_ON**: QSO start time (when callsign entered)
- **TIME_OFF**: QSO end time (when Save pressed)
- **Duration Calculation**: Automatic duration tracking

#### Timing Logic:
1. **Callsign Entry**: `qso_start_time` captured automatically
2. **QSO Progress**: Real-time duration display updates
3. **Save QSO**: End time captured, duration calculated
4. **Field Clear**: Start time reset for next QSO

### 4. Files Modified

#### Core Changes:
- `models/qso.py`: Added `time_off` field and TIME_OFF ADIF export
- `gui/tk_qso_form_clean.py`: Enhanced timing capture and display
- `gui/tk_qso_form_clean.py`: Updated for consistency (main W4GNS logger GUI)

#### Key Methods:
- `_on_callsign_change()`: Captures start time when callsign entered
- `_update_time_display()`: Shows QSO progress and duration
- `_save()`: Records end time and calculates duration
- `_clear_fields()`: Resets timing for next QSO

### 5. Ragchew Award Benefits

#### Accurate Timing:
- **Precise Start**: Captured exactly when QSO begins (callsign entry)
- **Precise End**: Captured exactly when QSO ends (save button)
- **Duration Tracking**: Real-time progress display
- **ADIF Compliance**: Standard TIME_ON/TIME_OFF fields

#### Award Validation:
- QSOs can be validated for minimum duration requirements
- Complete timing data available for contest/award submissions
- Automatic duration calculation eliminates manual timing errors

### 6. Testing Results

#### Timing Accuracy:
✅ **Start Time**: Captured when callsign entered (09:14:00 UTC)
✅ **End Time**: Captured when save pressed (09:29:23 UTC)  
✅ **Duration**: Calculated correctly (15:23)
✅ **ADIF Export**: TIME_OFF field included (092923)

#### User Interface:
✅ **Progress Display**: Real-time QSO duration shown
✅ **Save Dialog**: Enhanced with timing information
✅ **Field Reset**: Timing cleared for next QSO

#### ADIF Compliance:
✅ **TIME_ON**: Standard start time field
✅ **TIME_OFF**: Standard end time field
✅ **Format**: HHMMSS format as per ADIF specification

## Usage Example

### Normal Operation:
1. **Start QSO**: Enter callsign (e.g., "W4GNS")
   - Start time automatically captured
   - Display shows: "QSO in progress: 00:00 (Started: 09:14:00 UTC)"

2. **During QSO**: Continue conversation
   - Display updates: "QSO in progress: 05:30 (Started: 09:14:00 UTC)"

3. **End QSO**: Press "Save QSO"
   - End time captured
   - Duration calculated
   - Enhanced save confirmation shown

### Ragchew Award Application:
- QSOs with complete timing data can be easily identified
- Duration information readily available for award validation
- ADIF files contain all necessary timing fields for submissions

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

All QSO timing features are fully implemented and tested:
1. ✅ Start time captured when callsign entered
2. ✅ End time captured when QSO saved  
3. ✅ Real-time duration display
4. ✅ Enhanced save confirmation with timing
5. ✅ Complete ADIF export with TIME_ON/TIME_OFF
6. ✅ Ragchew award timing support

The SKCC Logger now provides comprehensive QSO timing data suitable for ragchew award tracking and validation!
